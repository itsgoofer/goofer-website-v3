      I'm an Italian enthusiast with a passion for blending art, music, and technology.
    </p>

    <p class="">
      My days are filled to the brim with activities; boredom is a foreign concept to me. When I'm
      not lost in the melodies of music composition, I'm deep in the world of coding. If not coding,
      you'll likely find me immersed in drawing or crafting 3D creations. And when I'm not fully
      engrossed in those pursuits, you might catch me battling it out in competitive video games or
      simply enjoying some downtime like any regular human being.
    </p>
    <p class="">
      Beyond my digital endeavors, I harbor a love for aviation â€“ fellow pilots, let's connect! I
      also have a fondness for biking (though it's been a while since I've hit the road), whipping
      up culinary delights in the kitchen, indulging in a good read, and continually expanding my
      knowledge base with new discoveries.
